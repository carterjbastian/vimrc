# Carter J. Bastian's .vimrc

Commands to configure vim. Depends on [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) and [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). Thanks to @wchargin for letting me use his .vimrc as a jumping off point. Still as work in progress.

## Roadmap
* Plugins
* Basic Settings
* Momvement Mappings
* Key re-mappings
* Leader-key mappings
* Custom Operations (Control-key mappings)
* Smaller Customization (meta-key mappings)
* File-type dependent autocommands
* Abbreviations and text shortcuts
